## How it works

This module was built on c++/cli (.Net) and uses [System.Diagnostics.EventLog](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.eventlog.aspx). 

In order to log events you need to run the application with an elevated account: ie administrator or system account. Windows services typically run under the system account, if you are looking on how to run node.js applications as a Windows Service have a look to [WinSer](https://github.com/jfromaniello/winser).


## TODO

- Use uv_queue_work to execute the writelog method in a different thread ( ? )
